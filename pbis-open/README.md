pbis-open Cookbook
================
This cookbook installs and configures PowerBroker Identity Services Open Edition on a Ubuntu server.

Requirements
------------

Tested on Ubuntu 12.04. Requires a chef-vault item with "username" and "password" keys to be created if the server will join the AD domain automatically. The credentials in the chef-vault item must have permission to join a computer in the domain, or a computer account must be pre-staged appropriately.

Usage
-----
#### pbis-open::default
Installs and configures PBIS Open. Joins the system to the AD domain if configured to do so (see requirements above). Single-line registry entries can be created under `node['pbis-open']['options']` and will be loaded on the next chef-client run. Multi-line entries other than "RequireMembershipOf" are not currently handled by this cookbook.

Note: PBIS Open installation requires a restart, which this cookbook does not handle.
